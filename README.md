# Idea Evaluator Engine

EcoSolveAI is our project featuring the Idea Evaluator Engine, a tool designed to enhance the innovation landscape. The AI-powered engine evaluates both the problem and proposed solution, providing a comprehensive score and detailed reasoning through an intuitive rating system.

What makes our tool unique is its natural language processing capabilities, allowing users to express their ideas in their own words. This facilitates a deep understanding of concepts, viability, and pain points. The evaluative criteria cover various factors, including the feasibility of the problem-solution pair, market potential, business model robustness, and financial projections.

Tailored for a diverse audience, from product managers to venture capitalists and ambitious founders, EcoSolveAI is a versatile companion throughout the innovation journey. Whether in the early stages of brainstorming or the crucial moment of pitch evaluation, our engine acts as a catalyst, supporting innovators in bringing their ideas to life.

Refer the backend and frontend files' respective readme(s) for instructions on running the project. Also make sure that you use your own API key to access OpenAI's wide array of LLMs.
